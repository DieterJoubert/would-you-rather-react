# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

A simple game of "Would You Rather," presenting two options for each poll question. 
Users can answer existing questions and see the results of questions they've voted on, or creat new questions. 
Users can also see a leaderboard based on who has answered and created the most questions.

## Dev Notes

* Built using Udacity's React guidelines while also incorporating functional components and hooks and the latest changes from 'react-router-dom' v6
* Future changes will include using typescript
